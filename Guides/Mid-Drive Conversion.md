For demonstration this guide will follow my conversion of RadPowerBikes RadWagon3 (which shares the same frame as RadWagon4 and RadWagon 2026), using a CYC Photon Gen 2 kit. I'll share a list of selected models whose frames maybe compatible with this conversion.

Hi, welcome to my guide for converting your RadWagon Gen 3/4/2026 to Mid Drive. As without saying but following this guide and any modification will result in voiding of your bike's warranty (if there's still any tbh). And your mileage may vary when it comes to sourcing parts, tools availability and other shenanigans you may encounter during the conversion process.

*Before I begin, some transparency: I was not paid by CYC, sponsored by any motor kit or battery dealers. All components were paid out of pocket and my commentary regarding my experience with sourcing the parts are all my opinion, as your experience will again vary.*

# Part 1: Parts List & Pricing

**TL;DR: The total price for the project was around $1.500+, which includes motor kit (with customisations), battery, additional parts & tools required. Depending on the tools you already have the pricing can be higher for the needed tools.**

**Motor Kit:** My choice: CYC Photon Gen 2 - $1,068 (When purchased via Golden Motor - a CYC dealer shop)

Customisation:  
\+ Intuition Display ($68) - Just a fancier display, most of the settings you can change via the app for the motor, but this is just my personal preference for a cleaner cockpit.

\+ 50T Chainring ($50) - This is a cargo bike, hence I decided to choose this for more torque transfer, as well as this kit originally planned for a RadRunner (more on that later).

\+ 78-83mm BSA Threaded: The bottom bracket of the RadWagon 3/4 measured at 83mm, and it's Shimano square bottom bracket, which thanksfully still industry standard size (since Rad likes to do proprietary parts whenever they can).

\+ CYC Full Twist Throttle: Again, completely up to preference, I do have experience with moped scooter and this is already in my comfort zone.

\+ Crank Arm 175mm: Again, completely up to preference & rider's build. I already planned to use the pedal for most of the usage and thus this is subjectively better torque transfer, as well as still clears the ground.

\+ Request for CYC 1x4 wiring harness, should you plan to add magnetic brake sensors (that will be covered in the next part).

\+ CYC Speed Sensor Extension Wire (300mm) ($12): You will going to need this, and you will have to find this component separately on your chosen dealer's website as it is for some reason not listed on the option page. Don't be like me found out the speed sensor was too short, ended up having to order again and paid shipping again.

**Battery Pack:** Small Downtube Battery - Hailong G56 Case, 18650 Cells (AffordableEbikes.CA)

This battery pack is practically the same size as the OE RadWagon battery, and I have confirmed it to fit in the front tetragon area of the frame. Maximum voltage and size is 52v 14Ah, which is more than plenty and more capacity than the OE spec. Unfortunately it is different connector than the OE battery (which the new motor swap will also has different battery connector anyway) so I recommend keeping the old battery in a fireproof container, should you want to keep the old parts, or recycle the battery.

**Wheels:** For RadWagon, you can still keep the rear motor wheel intact but know there is weight penalty which will cost range. The rear motor wheel is around 5kg (11lbs), while normal rear wheel are totalled around 2kg (4lbs).

My wheel choice is a Benno RemiDemi Rear Wheel, unfortunately it's sold out everywhere so you might have to source one yourself. In addition, the wheel I chosen turns out to be cassette-only, and thus I have to buy tools to remove and install a new cassette. I recommend finding a rear wheel that has freewheel hub, which the rear motor of RadWagon uses. You will still need freewheel hub removal tool (I recommend this one, ASIN B0DKBXKY21, which I also used to install new cassette to my rear wheel).

tl;dr: Cost-effective option is keeping the rear motor in, with penalty to weight and range.

If replacing rear wheel, the spec is 3/8 (9.5mm) x 175mm Bolt-on. If you are able to source a RemiDemi rear wheel (which OLD is 170mm), you will need 2x 2mm thick 3/8 washer to properly fit the wheel in the frame, mind the clearance for brake rotor.

Brake rotors bolts are also need to be removed with a T25 Torx driver.

**Tools:**

Depending on which motor kit you will get, the tools requirements may vary, but usually the following will always be needed:

\+ Hex Keys: You can get the usual hex keys set, folding hex keys, or get the T-handle hex keys or hex bits with a ratcheting driver. However the latter keys are not recommended since you can over-torque the bolts and strip the heads or the threads.

\+ Bottom Bracket Removal Tool: I recommend the tool with ASIN B0FP2BTS3N, I purchased it and works very well for removing bottom bracket of RadWagon & RadRunner. This will also requires a long 1/2 ratchet or breaker bar so I recommend sourcing from your local Harbor Freight or Lowe's.

\+ Crank Puller: I recommend the ASIN B0FCYWCG94. This one will be required for removal of cranks arms from old bottom bracket, and removal of new crank arms from the motor should you forgot to add shims between the crank arms and motor.

\+ Bottom Bracket Install Tool (If you opt for CYC Photon Gen 2 Kit): You will need a 44mm - 16 notch tool to tighten the bottom bracket. You can buy the socket offered by the seller if you want to use a torque wrench to tighten. Or buy this (ASIN B0F2MRLC3C) and tighten by hand.

**Optional Tools:** I recommend having a cutter for cutting the zip ties of the old wiring harness, and new zip ties to secure the new wiring harness; Electric impact wrench tool is very optional but recommended if you would like to make the removal of crank arm bolts and installing them easier, with some sockets it's will also be compatible with the crank puller I mentioned earlier.

**Additional Optional Modifications:** Hydraulic Brakes are very recommended with high wattage mid drive motors. Braking power is very important and I highly recommend upgrading from cable brakes to hydro brakes if possible. If opt in for hydraulic brakes, you will need to buy a set of magnetic brake sensors (ASIN B0DL9FRRF1 works for me at this time, will update if there's any failure)

Unfortunately the brake sensor connector on the OE brake levers are female connectors, which will not work with the CYC harness which are also female connector. You might have to source a male to male 3 pin connector if you want to keep the OE brake levers.

# Part 2: Installation

The following instruction is only applicable to CYC Photon Gen 2 kit. I believe others may be the same but look up appropriate owner manual, installation manual and guide videos for your chosen motor kit.

Installation is covered in CYC Photon Gen 2's owner manual. I highly recommend reading through the manual prior to purchasing to understand what you are getting yourself into. DIY is king in ebike conversion and if you found this too much to do, I recommend finding ebike retrofitter around your town to perform the job.

Note: Traditional bike shop, REI and other bike retailers may not willing to perform the conversion work. Their liability does not cover ebike retrofitting nor they are qualified to perform works on ebikes most of the time.

I also recommend Golden Motor's instruction video on how to perform installation of the CYC Photon Gen 2 kit. I followed both the video and owner manual to heart and was able to successfully install the motor well.

Additional feed back regarding assembly steps in the owner manual:

Step 1 & 3 requires no spacer, the bottom bracket of the RadWagon is correct size and does not require no spacer.

Step 4: After greasing the thread on the bottom bracket cup, I recommend threading the bottom bracket **BY HAND** completely until the cup threaded in fully. Do not use bottom bracket tool to force it in at any point. Remove and retry if you are not able to bottom out the cup. After threaded the cup in with the bracket, secure the bracket to the motor with the bolts same as instruction

Step 5 is when you can safely use the bottom bracket tool to tighten to spec.

Step 6: I recommend greasing the spindle entirely, when I install the spindle it went in smoothly and did not require the use of a mallet to hammer it in. I do not recommend using a mallet as in the instruction.

Step 7: The "step" on the lock ring is the small lip on the lock ring. The correct way to describe this step is having the smooth face of the lock ring facing inward toward to motor housing.

Step 8: Remember, remember to install the spindle spacer before putting on the crank arm. I had to take out the crank arm at the end to reinstall the spindle spacer I forgot in this step.

Step 10-14: If you have any confusion in this step, I recommend checking Golden Motor's video on this part of the process.
